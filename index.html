                    <b>Mahatma Gandhi </b>(born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi) Indian lawyer,
                    politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against
                    the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is
                    internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political
                    and social progress.

                    In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking
                    adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a
                    severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he
                    wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only
                    increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on
                    earth.

                    Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the
                    dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what
                    is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education.
                    He was, however, an able administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes,
                    their long-suffering subjects, and the headstrong British political officers in power.

                    Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did not care much for finery or
                    jewelry, divided her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out
                    in days and nights of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas grew up in a home
                    steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally
                    rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief that everything in the
                    universe is eternal. Thus, he took for granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings),
                    vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between adherents of various
                    creeds and sects.

                    The educational facilities at Porbandar were rudimentary; in the primary school that Mohandas
                    attended, the children wrote the alphabet in the dust with their fingers. Luckily for him, his
                    father became dewan of Rajkot, another princely state. Though Mohandas occasionally won prizes and
                    scholarships at the local schools, his record was on the whole mediocre. One of the terminal reports
                    rated him as “good at English, fair in Arithmetic and weak in Geography; conduct very good, bad
                    handwriting.” He was married at the age of 13 and thus lost a year at school. A diffident child, he
                    shone neither in the classroom nor on the playing field. He loved to go out on long solitary walks
                    when he was not nursing his by then ailing father (who died soon thereafter) or helping his mother
                    with her household chores.

                    He had learned, in his words, “to carry out the orders of the elders, not to scan them.” With such
                    extreme passivity, it is not surprising that he should have gone through a phase of adolescent
                    rebellion, marked by secret atheism, petty thefts, furtive smoking, and—most shocking of all for a
                    boy born in a Vaishnava family—meat eating. His adolescence was probably no stormier than that of
                    most children of his age and class. What was extraordinary was the way his youthful transgressions
                    ended.
